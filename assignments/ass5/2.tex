\section{Question 2}

\begin{question}
    Using the same data set and models, conduct a permutation test for the same hypotheses. How do your p-values compare?
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{verbatim}
        # Using the same data set and models, conduct a permutation test for the same hypothe-
        # ses. How do your p-values compare?
        # Compute the original F statistic
        forg <- summary(lmO)$fstat
        # Initialize the p-value
        pval2=0
        # Create the for loop
        for (i in 1:4000){
          # Fit the model with the permuting
          lmnew <- lm(gamble~sample(sex)+income, data = teengamb)
          # Find out whether the F stistic is bigger
          if(summary(lmnew)$fstat > forg){
            # if bigger, add it to the p value
            pval=pval+1/4000
          }
        }
        # return the p-value
        pval
    \end{verbatim}
    The p-value I got from the code above is $0.00796732$ which is a little bigger than the $p$-value we have in the previous question, but it is still below $0.05$, so we could draw the conclusion that controlling for \verb+income+, we are $95\%$ confident that \verb+sex+ "affect" \verb+gamble+.
